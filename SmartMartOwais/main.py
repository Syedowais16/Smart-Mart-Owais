# Selected: MVC (Model-View-Controller)
# ðŸŽ¯ Justification:
# Clear separation of concerns:
#
# Model = Data Logic (ProductModel, BillModel)
#
# View = GUI (AdminView, CashierView)
#
# Controller = Business Logic (add/delete product, checkout)
#
# Easy to test and debug each component independently
#
# Faster development for GUI-based apps like Tkinter
#
# Avoids unnecessary complexity of N-Tier for small-to-medium apps
